# Data Directory

The `northwind.sqlite` database is not included in the repository to keep it lightweight.

To generate it locally, run the command found in the root README:
```bash
curl -L -o data/northwind.sqlite https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/main/dist/northwind.db
```
